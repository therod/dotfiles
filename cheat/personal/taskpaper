Marking a task as done will add the "@done" context tag to the end of the task,
and it will be greyed out by the syntax file.

To show all tasks with a particular context tag, type \ts and a tag name to
search. If you use the \ts command over the desired context tag, the tag name
is set as default value. This will fold all the irrelevant tasks leaving only
the tasks in the current context visible.

To fold all top-level projects leaving only the headings visible use the \tp
command. Standard fold commands can be used to open (zo) and close (zc)
individual projects.

To show all projects and tasks use the zR command. This disables folding so
that the entire file is expanded.

To go to next or previous project use the \tj command or \tk command. To go to
a project you specify use the \tg command. You can complete project names with
on prompt.
