window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  dimensions:
    columns: 150
    lines: 50

  #
  # Window position (changes require restart)
  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  # position:
  #   x: 0
  #   y: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 5
    y: 5

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  #dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: none

  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:
  #   - Windowed
  #   - Maximized
  #   - Fullscreen
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode` (macOS only):
  #   - SimpleFullscreen

  # Window title
  #title: Alacritty


scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.
  history: 10000

  # Number of lines the viewport will move for every line scrolled when
  # scrollback is enabled (history > 0).
  multiplier: 3

# Font configuration
font:
  # Normal (roman) font face
  normal:
    family: Inconsolata

  bold:
    family: Inconsolata
    style: Bold
  italic:
    family: Inconsolata
    style: Italic
  size: 14.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the right,
  # increasing `y` moves the glyph upwards.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

# Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
#
# Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina screens
# it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`
#
# macOS >= 10.14.x:
#
# If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
# `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
# following command:
#   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
#
# This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
# effect.
use_thin_strokes: true

# Background opacity
#
# Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.
